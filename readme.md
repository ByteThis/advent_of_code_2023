# Advent of Code 2023 Solutions

This repository contains my Python-based solutions to the Advent of Code 2023 challenges.

Each day's solution is separated into `part_1.py` and `part_2.py` for each section of the challenge.
<br>Execute them using `python part_1.py` or `python part_2.py` accordingly.

<br>
All approaches are optimized and not brute-force solutions.
